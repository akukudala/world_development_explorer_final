Many governments publish statistics showing how well their education systems are working and improving, with data on enrollment and completion. Monitoring progress toward national and global education targets helps allocate resources more efficiently and make quality learning opportunities accessible to all. Better-quality education leads to an empowered citizenry and a more productive labor force. We will also analyze the mentioned region with the other regions in the world as per data derived from World Development Explorer. The reason why most of the females in the world are left uneducationed is due to their financial background. Let us consider the Financial states of the region to compare the correlation between the education and the income.
